# CSS Animator

CSS Animator is a free application that simplifies the process of building CSS animations.

[Click here](https://css-animator.vercel.app) to start building your animations!

## Features

### Timeline
The main goal of this application is to provide a timeline that resembles a video editor.
The timeline represents the duration of your animation. It shows the progress of the animation as you play it. You can click and drag the timeline to move it to a specific point in the animation.
